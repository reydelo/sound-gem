    <h1>Welcome to SoundGem</h1>
    <h3>Your resource for finding those precious gems on Soundcloud </h3>
    <b></b>
    <p>SoundGem acts as a filter for your Soundcloud stream. We do this by pulling in every track that was liked by your <%= current_user.soundcloud_client.get('/me').followings_count %> friends.</p>
    <b></b>
    <p>We eliminate duplicate posts and underrated tracks from your stream. We'll also exposes you to new music by showing you tracks by artists you may not be follwing yet.</p>
    <b></b>
    <p>Your personalized stream can be sorted by popularity among your friends, release date, or simply shuffled. Also check out a friend's profile to listen to their favorite tracks or current posts.</p>
    <b></b>
    <p>SoundGem is a work in progress.  Keep checking in for new features.</p>
